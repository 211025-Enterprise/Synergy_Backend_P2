Synergy's Project 2 Repository

Jennica's Rules to the GitHub
- To merge to the main repository you need permission from one other.
- Commits should be logical and/or informative.

````git checkout master
git pull
git checkout feature-xyz  # name of your hypothetical feature branch
git rebase master  # may need to fix merge conflicts in feature-xyz````javascript
